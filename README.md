This is a hobby project, meant to explore how to represent functional structures, such as monads, in C#.

You are free to use the code found in this repository in any way you wish. It should however be noted that the code is not well tested or documented, and as such not recommended for serious use. No guarantees are made regarding backward-compatibility, as I may change anything at a whim, at any point in time.
